# Weather-App

Native tech stack (HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript) were used to create this project.

This project uses [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current) API

For displaying modal message I used [SweetAlert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/).

## About the app

You can search weather information in any city in world wide.

You are getting specific weather icon, weather description, information about temperature, how many celcius it feels like and the info about humidity.
